# Connect4-AI
this is a version of connect 4 that I wrote that includes AI. it might not be the best AI, but it is still a form of it. (I think)

Note: This is just a random project I made for class.

The yellow piece is the marker for where your piece will go.

There are 4 levels of difficulty in the AI. by default it is on the hardest level.
The level of difficulty can be changed by changing a number in base.Main.main(). The number to change is in the constructor for AIPlayer.
The difficulty settings are detailed in comments next to the constructor.

Your pieces are RED

Enemy pieces are BLUE

The controls are: 

  Left arrow key => Move piece left

  Right arrow key => Move piece right

  Enter => Place piece
